      <p>This piece - entitled Falling Stars was my final project for CTK 204 - Foundations: Music Concepts. This was the first piece I made that I was proud of. Although basic, the compositional elements of the song make for a song worth a listen.</p>

        This piece was created for my CTK 345 - Sequencing and Digital Audio class. This project made me create variation in the synth sounds I was using so that they changed over time. Overall, I think this project turned out really nicely

This piece was created for my CTK 203 - Recording and Sampling class final. My friend Evan helped me with this project. I really like the easy-going vibe of the whole piece. I am currently working on this piece to make it longer.

    This piece was created for my CTK 345 - Sequencing and Digital Audio class final. It has much more emotion in it then the other pieces. If I had to pick a favorite song I made, it would be this one.
